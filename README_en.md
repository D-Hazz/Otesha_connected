# Otesha_connected

Otesha Connected is an IoT system designed for real-time monitoring and control of a physical environment. It combines sensors, a microcontroller, and a software application to collect, analyze, and visualize data, using a simple, scalable approach suitable for resource-constrained contexts.

# Otesha Connected

Otesha Connected is a smart connected system (IoT) project built for real-time monitoring and control of a physical environment. It relies on the integration of sensors, a microcontroller, and a software interface to reliably collect, process, and exploit data.

## Project Objectives

- Implement a functional and modular IoT solution  
- Ensure real-time data collection and transmission  
- Visualize data through a simple and usable interface  
- Design an architecture suitable for resource-limited environments  
- Serve as an educational and experimental base for smart systems  

## General Architecture

The system is structured around three main layers:

1. **Hardware Layer**
   - Sensors (temperature, humidity, or others depending on the use case)
   - Microcontroller for data acquisition and preprocessing

2. **Communication Layer**
   - Data transmission to the central system
   - Lightweight protocols adapted to hardware constraints

3. **Software Layer**
   - Backend for data reception and management
   - User interface for real-time visualization and monitoring

## Technologies Used

- Microcontroller (e.g. Arduino, ESP32, or equivalent)
- Environmental sensors
- Backend (Python / Django or equivalent)
- Web frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Lightweight database for data storage and history

## Possible Use Cases

- Environmental monitoring
- Educational smart systems
- Low-cost IoT projects
- Prototyping of local connected solutions

## Project Status

The project is under active development and will progressively evolve with:
- the integration of additional sensors
- improvements to the user interface
- optimization of data collection and analysis

## License

This project is intended for educational and experimental use. The license will be specified later.
